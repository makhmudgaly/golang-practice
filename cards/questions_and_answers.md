# Variables

```go
var card string = "Ace of Spades"
```
var -> create new variable
card -> name of variable
string -> type of variable

Another way of creating of variable is 
```go
card := "Ace of Spades"
```

Compiler figures out the type by itself
Use ***:=*** only for creating new variable
```go
card = "Five of Diamonds"
```
